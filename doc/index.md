# iCAGES Documentation

iCAGES is an efficient software tool to prioritizes personalized cancer driver mutations, genes and drugs. Given input in ANNOVAR input format, VCF format or BED format, iCAGES can generate a list of 

- iCAGES mutation scores for all point coding variants, non-coding variants and structural variations, which measure genomic cancer driving potential of these variants.

- iCAGES gene scores for all mutated genes, which measure personal cancer driving potential of these genes.

- iCAGES drug scores for all potential drugs targeting any gene mutated in this particular patient.
